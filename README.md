# DELHI-metro-shortest-route

INTRODUCTION: This C++ code implements real time use case of Dijkstras algorithm to find the shortest path from source to every destination.Here we have considered a city with 56 stations. Each station is assigned an integer value from 0 which also represent the station number,when the user enters the source station Dijkstras algorithm is applied and least no of stations from the source to every other station is calculated and displayed.
Any user can enter the stations in there respective city and change the matrix accordingly.

COMPLEXITY: The time complexity of Dijkstras algorithm is O(V^2),where V is the number of vertices in the graph.The space complexity of Dijkstras algorithm is O(V).
